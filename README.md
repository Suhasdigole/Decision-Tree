# Decision-Tree

Decision Trees:

Logic: Decision trees split data into subsets based on feature values, creating branches that lead to a decision node or a leaf.
Description: The tree uses a series of if-then rules derived from the features to predict outcomes, with each node representing a decision point based on a feature's value.

Practical examples:
Eg 1- Analyzing which features (like price, marketing spend, and product type) are most important in predicting whether a new product will be successful.
Eg 2- Predicting loan approval by analyzing factors like applicant's credit score, income, and loan amount.

In the above code we use Decision tree algorithm, to determine the salary (above 100k $) depending on Company Job and Degree.
